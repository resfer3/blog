# The moral conflict between the humanities and innovation

Now, before I begin, I have to establish first that the following investigation to this specific topic is based in my opinion from
what I have experienced as a 90's kid and depending in anyone's perspective this could be controversial. I strongly 
encourage to make your own assumptions about this topic, because it could be the freezing power that is stopping you from pursuing
the highest good, the great adventure that, if purposefully aimed at, could be eternal. 

### Innovation

I have to say it's incredible that we, as human beings, have achieved the technological wonders that are running our current world at
the moment. From reusable space rockets to smartphones, and all the software in between. But, maybe, it happened too fast. 

The repercussions of the acceleration of innovation has been an understated topic that has almost destroyed our foundations and values as a
society. We have been admiring the pros of innovation but we have been leaving aside the cons of it. There has been a sharp decline in moral, 
ethical values, which the universities started with their political views about the world, and then with the information overload and 
connectivity that the World Wide Web has been providing at basically no cost. Basically, creating an utopia optimized for distraction and
entertainment from all angles. Which means, almost all innovation today is directed towards trendiness and experiences? (I'll leave this
question for another day)

Then, Does that mean that the interconnection created by the social media platforms is wrong?
In my opinion, yes. I think it has brought to life more evil than good. When society builds their framework about what is trending in 
instagram, tiktok, or x. And they can't tell who is saying the right stuff, because, let's be honest, if you didn't pursue a true humanities education, 
which was the value of the universities until the late 90's, then you are easily gonna become corrupted, and degenerate into mediocrity.

Additionally, for those platforms to be completely free was a monumental error that was built on the idea "let people be free to communicate",
I'm not against that idea, but it's completely wrong. Because it leaves the consequences out at the door, and it leaves the psychopaths to take
control of the communities "at - no - cost". They can even do it anonymously without the pain of destroying their own reputations.
Some people figured out at least a way to get the psychopaths, scammers, and bots. Which is to make those types of community apps "PAID".
That will immediately destroy the aforementioned criminals and let people debate with their social trust in hand. There must be consequences, 
if used in bad faith, in communication. Language being the most powerful weapon we command as desired.

### The Consequences of Innovation and, some sort of a solution
The issue with the millenials (1981-1996), which I am by the way, is that one day we didn't have the internet and we had to go outside and
play with friends, contribute to our communities, seek knowledge in libraries. Now, we have every pleasure 
at our hands, we don't even have to go the theater to watch a great movie that just came out, we can play any videogame for hours, and 
most importantly, we can do this for years and forget pain, in a sense.

Well... the issue with forgetting our moral virtues and responsabilites towards, not ourselves, but our society. Is that we grow
purposeless and followers of our own hedonistic pleasures. We do not let our interests manifest and guide us into the future. 
I've been guilty of this for many years, currently paying a painful, but necessary, debt towards myself and my community.
That's why I've started to read the great authors of the past, they figured out many of the philosophical psychological diseases that
were going to occur in the future, if we killed "GOD", per say.

To add to this, teaching yourself the humanities is hard, because you don't want to fall into pathological views about the world. How can
you tell which books are the ones to read, fiction or non-fiction? Which authors should you read to get yourself a rock solid foundation going
forward? You can't be ever sure, but it seems the right texts are the ones that are not promoted in universities, and are sort of left out
of the literary studies within these institutions, there are "great authors" and we should aim to read the great texts of the past.
Keyword "GREAT", it's actually pretty easy to determine the great, from the mediocre writers. Just read what the people you admire read,
a combination of those books should give you a great understanding of your own values and create your tools to tackle the future, full-force.
To become articulate, is to become the most dangerous human you can ever be, and with all that power, tell the truth and be a force of goodness.

Obviously, you can disregard this article and never think about this ever again. But, if you have any interest in reading the intellectual
characters of the 19th and 18th century, to understand the human condition at a deep fundamental level, then I urge you to embark in this literary adventure.
Choose the titles that pique your interest, look for the titles that your heroes from today read, let those texts debate in your head, and in consequence,
you will become someone you never thought possible.
That's my hypothesis anyways, I believe it to be true.

This list, in my opinion, is a great index of classical authors with years of content about the aforementioned topic.
So, I will shamelessly steal this from Jordan Peterson, which I admire greatly, read essentially anything from:

- Dostoevsky
- Tolstoy
- Solzhenitsyn
- Orwell
- Huxley
- Nietzsche
- Jung

He has a great list of classical literature in his [homepage](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/books/).

Finally, to my fellow millenials, Technology is SUPER COOL. As a tech-nerd myself I've been marveled, excited, perplexed at the computation we have been
able to achieve, and we keep evolving, which is amazing. We make computers do our bidding, and in a far future, AI will do our wishes for even more complex
problems. This is for my techies by the way, if you think about it, if you are not able to properly "ARTICULATE" your point to your fellow humans, 
what makes you think that you will be able to ask the best questions to your AI. 
Just a thought.
